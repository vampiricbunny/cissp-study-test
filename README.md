## Note this code is ment to be ran offline. for self study only (it is not secure)

This contains more than 3,200 questions from the CISSP and is a good resource for studying. However, it is meant to be run offline due to the fact that it's just standard HTML. If possible, I will also include a PDF book for additional study.

- This is meant to be a proof of concept (and I was already studying the material, so I thought Iâ€™d include it here).
